I am reluctant to put this in here, since it contains a parquet file of 400MB which cannot be uploaded to GitHub easily. 

Potential improvements:
 - use https://huggingface.co/datasets/hugging-science/arc-aphasia-bids (though this might increase load times!)
 - overlay lesion and t1w/t2w images to show visualize data of a patient in one 3D image
